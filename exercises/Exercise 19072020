2020 has been a hard year. We're already in the half of the year and I can't remember the last good thing it happened. The Coronavirus' pandemic put life of all of us upside down. Since about March we need to stay home for protecting ourselves and the others. Before all this, go out with friends, go to the movies, go for walking, drop over someone among other communs things were normal. But, today everybody must avoid things like that. The whole world was affected by a terrible virus that has been causing troubles to many people. If a vaccine won't be discovered soon, all of us will live in a completely different way from we used to be live for a long time. You wouldn't believe me wheter I talk about all of this in the beggining of the year. Would you? The science is our only hope. Everything is gonna be fine.
